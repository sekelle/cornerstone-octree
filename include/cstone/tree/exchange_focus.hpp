/*! @file
 * @brief Request counts for a locally present node structure of a remote domain from a remote rank
 *
 * @author Sebastian Keller <sebastian.f.keller@gmail.com>
 *
 * Overall procedure for each pair for peer ranks (rank1, rank2):
 *      1.  rank1 sends a node structure (vector of SFC keys) to rank2. The node structure sent by rank1
 *          covers the assigned domain of rank2. The node structure cannot exceed the resolution of
 *          the local tree of rank2, this is guaranteed by the tree-build process, as long as all ranks
 *          use the same bucket size for the locally focused tree. Usually, rank1 requests the full resolution
 *          along the surface with rank2 and a lower resolution far a way from the surface.
 *
 *      2.  rank2 receives the the node structure, counts particles for each received node and sends back
 *          an answer with the particle counts per node.
 *
 *      3. rank1 receives the counts for the requested SFC keys from rank2
