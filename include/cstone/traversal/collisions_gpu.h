 * @param[in]  internalToLeaf    map leaf node indices of fully linked format to cornerstone order
 * @param[in]  leaves            cstone array of leaf node keys
 * @param[in]  interactionRadii  effective halo search radii per octree (leaf) node
 * @param[in]  box               coordinate bounding box
 * @param[in]  firstNode         first cstone leaf node index to consider as local
 * @param[in]  lastNode          last cstone leaf node index to consider as local
 * @param[out] collisionFlags    array of length numLeafNodes, each node that is a halo
 *                               from the perspective of [firstNode:lastNode] will be marked
 *                               with a non-zero value.
 *                               Note: does NOT reset non-colliding indices to 0, so @p collisionFlags
 *                               should be zero-initialized prior to calling this function.
