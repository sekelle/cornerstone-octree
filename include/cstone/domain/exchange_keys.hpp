/*! @brief exchange halo request keys, establish particle indices to send
 *
 * @tparam KeyType      32- or 64-bit unsigned integer
 * @param treeLeaves    cornerstone octree leaves, length N+1
 * @param haloFlags     0 or 1 for each node in @p leaves, length N
 *                      nodes marked with 1 are halos of the executing rank
 * @param particleKeys  sorted SFC keys of locally assigned particles
 * @param offset        the start position of the locally assigned particles that they will
 *                      have in the particles buffers after halo exchange
 * @param assignment    assignment of @p treeLeaves to ranks, only ranks listed in @p peerRanks
 *                      are accessed
 * @param peerRanks     list of peer rank IDs
 * @return              a SendList, containing ranges of local particle indices to send out
 *                      to each peer rank in subsequent halo particle exchanges.
 *
 * Preconditions:
 *
 *    Let node index i on rank r1 be marked as a halo, i.e. haloFlags[i] == 1.
 *    - Then the assigned rank of i, r2 = assignment.findRank(i) has to be listed in @p peerRanks,
 *      otherwise the request is not sent and r1 will not receive those halos in the subsequent
 *      halo particle exchange, which will cause it to fail.
 *    - r1 sends the range [treeLeaves[i]:treeLeaves[i+1]] to r2, so that range has to be part of
 *      the assignment of r2.
